## OCA_Example_Bird

This is a complete example featuring blending modes, groups, and the *passthrough* option for groups.

It was made in Krita 5.1.1.

There are two different versions, as the reference implementation of an OCA exporter in Krita has the option to either export all layers at the same size at the document (cropped if bigger, with empty space if smaller), or retain their original size (which may be bigger or smaller than the document).
