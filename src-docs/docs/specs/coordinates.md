# Coordinates and transform

All coordinates (position) are given **relative to the top left corner of their container** (the [*Root Object*](root.md), or the containing grouplayer for layers, or the containing paintlayer for frames).

The **position** of objects ([layers](layer.md) and [frames](frame.md)) is **the coordinate of the center of their bounding box** in their container.

!!! WIP
    We're planning to add full layer transform to OCA, with pivot, scale and rotation.
